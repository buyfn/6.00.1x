set bestshift to 0
set max number of valid words to 0
apply each shift from 0 to 25 to ciphertext
  apply shift to ciphertext
  split ciphertext into list of words
  count number of valid words in the list
  if number of valid words for shift is bigger than max number of words:
    set new max number of words
    set new best shift
return shift that provided with max number of valid words
apply found shift to ciphertext
